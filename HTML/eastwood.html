            <p class="content1">He was a large baby at 11 lb 6 oz (5.16 kg) and was named "Samson" by the nurses at the St. Francis Hospital. Eastwood has English, Scottish, Dutch and Irish ancestry. <br>
                <br>
                The elder of two siblings, he has a younger sister, Jeanne Bernhardt, born in 1934. His father worked as a salesman and briefly a detective in San Francisco, according to U.S. Census records, and at different jobs along the West Coast during the 1930s.<br>
                <br>          
                In 1940, the Eastwoods settled in Piedmont, California and did not move again until after Clint reached adulthood. Eastwood often drops references to the Great Depression in interviews, implying that he comes from a poor family, but according to Sondra Locke, "Actually they were never poor, they lived in a very wealthy part of town, had a swimming pool, belonged to the country club, and each drove his own car."</p>

                <p class="content2">Eastwood worked odd jobs during and after high school, with stints as a hay baler, logger, truck driver and steel-furnace stoker. In 1950, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and stationed at Fort Ord on the Monterey Peninsula, where he served as a swimming instructor.<br>
                    <br>        
                    After his discharge in 1953, Eastwood wound his way down to Los Angeles, where he took classes at Los Angeles City College and worked at a gas station. Tall and handsome, he landed a screen test with Universal and signed a contract despite minimal acting experience. His first roles were bit parts in films like Revenge of the Creature and Francis in the Navy, both released in 1955. <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1958, Eastwood scored his big break with a major part in the TV Western Rawhide. Playing Rowdy Yates, second in command to Eric Fleming's trail boss, Eastwood slid seamlessly into the role of a hotheaded young cowboy. His character matured over the course of the program's eight seasons, with Yates taking over as trail boss toward the end. <br>
                    <br>
                    In the 1960s, Eastwood traveled to Italy to star in a trio of Westerns directed by Sergio Leone. The role Eastwood took—the cool, laconic "Man with No Name"—had been turned down by James Coburn and Charles Bronson. The trio of films included 1964's A Fistful Of Dollars (a remake of the Akira Kurosawa classic Yojimbo), For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). Nicknamed "spaghetti Westerns" due to their Italian production, these films gained worldwide popularity, and Eastwood became internationally known.</p>
